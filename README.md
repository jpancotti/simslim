# simslim

Run a lot more iOS simulators on one Mac by turning off the background daemons a simulator doesn't need.

A freshly booted iOS simulator starts around 180 background services: Siri, Spotlight indexing, photo analysis, News, wallpaper posters, iCloud sync, and so on. None of it matters when you're using the simulator for development, testing, or CI. simslim switches those services off, which cuts each simulator's memory roughly 4x. On the same laptop you go from a handful of simulators to a screenful.

*19 iOS simulators, all under automation, on a 16 GB MacBook Pro. Stock simulators start thrashing at around 5.*

## Numbers

One simulator, booted stock and then slimmed, same device and settle time (M1 Pro, 16 GB):

| | Stock | Slim |
|---|---|---|
| Processes | 258 | 70 |
| Memory | 4.0 GB | 0.9 GB |

Memory here is phys_footprint, the figure Activity Monitor shows, which counts compressed and swapped pages. That's what decides how many simulators fit before the machine starts swapping. Run `simslim measure <udid>` to see it for any booted simulator.

## Install

```sh
brew install mobai-app/tap/simslim
```

or

```sh
go install github.com/mobai-app/simslim/cmd/simslim@latest
```

macOS only, and you need Xcode with an iOS Simulator runtime, since simslim
drives simulators through `xcrun simctl`.

## macOS app

The SwiftUI app bundles the CLI and adds:

- Searchable simulator status, disk-size, and live RAM columns.
- Searchable service profiles with per-daemon controls and purpose summaries.
- Read-only disk analysis plus confirmed cleanup of allowlisted data.
- A Derived Data mode that scans Xcode's generated folders and deletes only
  explicitly selected project or shared-cache directories.
- Clone, rename, erase, delete, and Finder shortcuts.

Build it locally with Go and Xcode:

```sh
make app
open build/SimSlim.app
```

Memory estimates are guidance rather than additive savings; see the
[measurement method](docs/category-memory.md). SimSlim recommends cloning before
service or disk changes so the copy can serve as a backup.

## Usage

```sh
simslim list             # simulators and their slim status (--booted to filter)
simslim profiles         # what a slim boot turns off
simslim profiles <id>    # the daemons in one category
simslim on <udid>        # slim a simulator and reboot it slim
simslim off <udid>       # put it back to stock
simslim status <udid>    # how slim a booted simulator is
simslim verify <udid> --profile ci.json   # exact profile match; non-zero on drift
simslim doctor <udid> --requires push,storekit,universal-links
simslim measure <udid>   # a booted simulator's memory footprint
simslim top              # live fleet monitor; enter a sim for per-daemon RAM/CPU
simslim size <udid>      # total allocated simulator size
simslim disk-plan <udid> # measure reclaimable data; read-only
simslim disk-clean --categories caches,logs --confirm <udid>
simslim derived-data     # scan Xcode Derived Data; read-only
simslim derived-data-clean --entry <directory-name> --confirm
simslim clone <udid> <name>
simslim rename <udid> <name>
simslim boot <udid>      # boot a simulator and wait for its services
simslim shutdown <udid>  # shut down a booted simulator
simslim erase <udid>     # erase apps, data, settings, and slimming overrides
simslim delete <udid>    # permanently delete a simulator
```

Read-only and simulator-management commands accept `--json` for integrations
and the macOS app.

### Slow CI runners

`simslim on` boots the simulator, disables ~170 daemons one `launchctl` call at a
time, then reboots — all under a single 10-minute deadline. Shared CI runners (like
GitHub-hosted macOS runners) are slower and less predictable, and can blow that
deadline mid-reconfigure with `context deadline exceeded` errors. Raise it with the
global `--boot-timeout` flag or the `SIMSLIM_BOOT_TIMEOUT` environment variable:

```sh
simslim on <udid> --boot-timeout 15m
# or, for the whole job:
export SIMSLIM_BOOT_TIMEOUT=15m
```

Each individual `launchctl` transition is also bounded by its own 2-minute
timeout, and the first transitions after a cold boot can exceed that on slow
hosts (failed ones are retried automatically). Raise it with the global
`--spawn-timeout` flag or the `SIMSLIM_SPAWN_TIMEOUT` environment variable:

```sh
simslim on <udid> --spawn-timeout 5m
# or, for the whole job:
export SIMSLIM_SPAWN_TIMEOUT=5m
```

## Disk cleanup

Disk cleanup is permanent and separate from service slimming. `disk-plan` is
read-only. `disk-clean` shuts down the exact simulator, clears only allowlisted
per-device directories, and refuses to run without `--confirm`.

```sh
simslim disk-categories
simslim disk-plan <udid>
simslim disk-clean --categories caches,logs,temporary --confirm <udid>
# Optional: also remove on-demand language models
simslim disk-clean --categories linguistic-data --confirm <udid>
```

Built-in apps and core OS language resources are part of a signed iOS runtime
shared by every simulator using that version, so simslim never modifies them.
Required Siri assets are measured only because iOS restores them on launch;
on-demand language data is opt-in and may download again when needed.

`disk-plan` also reports a read-only storage breakdown for installed app bundles,
Documents, app data, and user media. Those durable rows are never eligible for
cleanup. See the [disk cleanup safety model](docs/disk-cleanup.md) for recovery
behavior, safeguards, and Xcode 26.6 validation results.

## Derived Data

The app's **Derived Data** segment scans
`~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`, sorts its generated directories by
allocated size, and lets you remove stale projects or oversized shared caches.
Project rows identify the source workspace and most recently built app, including
its bundle identifier, app version, build number, package version, configuration,
platform, SDK, and minimum OS when Xcode recorded those values. Missing source
workspaces are called out so abandoned build data is easier to recognize.
Scanning is read-only. Cleanup requires confirmation and permanently deletes only
the exact direct-child directories selected from that scan.

```sh
simslim derived-data
simslim derived-data-clean \
  --entry FleetDog-gqunbotdqvgsfeemshfcnsyrblmp \
  --entry ModuleCache.noindex \
  --confirm
```

Xcode regenerates deleted build products, indexes, module caches, and package
working data, so the next build or index may be slower. Project source, Archives,
iOS DeviceSupport, simulator data, and the DerivedData root itself are outside
the cleanup boundary. Avoid deleting while a build is running. See the
[Derived Data safety model](docs/derived-data.md) for the exact safeguards.

Keep a category you actually need, like Spotlight search:

```sh
simslim on <udid> --except search
```

Or keep one specific daemon, like push notifications:

```sh
simslim on <udid> --keep com.apple.apsd
```

### Profile files

For a repeatable setup, commit a JSON profile alongside your project and apply it
per run. A `ci.json` and a `dev.json` can slim differently for each purpose:

```json
{
  "name": "ci",
  "description": "UI test runs",
  "except": ["search", "store"],
  "keep": ["com.apple.apsd"]
}
```

```sh
simslim on <udid> --profile ci.json
```

`except` and `keep` mirror the flags of the same name; `name` and `description`
are for whoever reads the file. Unknown fields, unknown category IDs, and labels
that no category disables are rejected, so a typo fails loudly. `--profile` is the
single source of truth for its run and cannot be combined with `--except` or
`--keep`.

To build one interactively, run `simslim profile ci.json`: name it, then use the
arrow keys and space to tick whole features to keep enabled, or press `→` to open
a feature and keep individual daemons within it. Point it at a directory to save
`<name>.json` there, or omit the path to print to stdout.

### Checking a simulator with doctor

Slimming a simulator turns features off on purpose, so a test suite that needs
one of them wants a fast way to catch a mis-slimmed simulator before it runs.
`doctor` checks a booted simulator against the features you name and exits
non-zero if any of them are broken, which makes it a natural CI preflight:

```sh
simslim doctor <udid> --requires push,storekit,universal-links
```

```
<udid>: 2/3 required features OK
  ok     push
  ok     universal-links
  BROKEN storekit — com.apple.storekitd disabled
```

Feature IDs are finer-grained than the slimming categories: each maps to just
the daemons that back one capability. Run `simslim doctor --list` to see them
all. Both the check and the list support `--json`.

### Verifying a profile still holds

The disable overrides are per-simulator state that is easy to lose without
noticing: a `clone` comes up stock, so does a deleted-and-recreated device or a
simulator from a new runtime, and nothing else fails loudly when that happens
— the simulator just quietly runs heavy again. `verify` compares a booted
simulator's overrides against a profile — the same `--profile`/`--except`/`--keep`
you passed to `on` — and exits non-zero listing the drift, so a script or CI
step can catch it and re-run `simslim on` (idempotent: it only applies the
missing delta) to repair:

```sh
simslim verify <udid> --profile ci.json || simslim on <udid> --profile ci.json
```

Where `doctor` answers "do the features my tests need still work?", `verify`
answers "is this simulator in exactly the slim state I configured?". Supports
`--json`.

## Use as a Go library

The repo root is an importable package with no external dependencies, so you can
drive simulators from your own tooling instead of shelling out to the CLI:

```sh
go get github.com/mobai-app/simslim
```

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/mobai-app/simslim"
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()

	devices, err := simslim.ListDevices(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Slim every booted simulator, keeping Siri and search enabled.
	profile, err := simslim.BuildProfile("", "siri,search", "")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	for _, d := range devices {
		if d.State != "Booted" {
			continue
		}
		changed, err := simslim.EnableSlim(ctx, d.Set, d.UDID, profile, func(msg string) {
			fmt.Println(d.UDID, msg)
		})
		fmt.Println(d.UDID, "changed:", changed, "err:", err)
	}
}
```

The package never writes to stdout — it returns values and reports progress
through the `simslim.Reporter` callback you pass in. `simslim.Categories`,
`simslim.Features`, and `simslim.SlimmableSet()` expose the same allowlist the
CLI uses. macOS only, since everything runs through `xcrun simctl`.

## How it works

`simslim on` writes persistent `launchctl disable` entries for the chosen daemons into the simulator's own launchd database, then reboots it. The entries stick across reboots, so the simulator comes up slim in a single boot from then on. `simslim off` clears them and reboots back to stock. Service slimming never changes the host Mac: only the exact simulator you point it at and daemons that are safe to disable. The separately confirmed Derived Data cleanup is the sole host-storage feature. Core workflow services such as `sharingd`, plus the handful that wedge a simulator when turned off, are left running.

Older runtimes do not persist launchd overrides across a reboot (observed on
iOS 17): `launchctl` accepts each disable, but the simulator comes back stock.
`simslim on` reads the state back after its reboot and fails with a clear error
instead of claiming success, so slimming requires an iOS 18 or newer runtime.

This is per-simulator state, not a global setting. The daemon disables live in that one simulator's launchd database and nowhere else. `simslim clone` does not carry them over: a clone comes up stock and has to be slimmed again with `simslim on`. The same goes for `erase`, `delete` and recreate, or "Erase All Content and Settings", so after any of those the simulator's memory climbs back to stock until you rerun `simslim on`. A simulator created from a new or updated runtime also starts stock. Copying the simulator's device directory does keep the disables, so a tar or a filesystem snapshot (how CI images are usually built) restores a slim simulator as slim. Run `simslim list` to see which simulators are currently slim, or `simslim verify` to check one against a specific profile.

## What you lose

Turning services off is fine for most development, UI automation, and CI, but some features genuinely stop working. The ones worth knowing:

- Spotlight and in-Settings search return nothing (`search`).
- Push notifications need `apsd`, StoreKit testing needs `storekitd` (`store`).
- Universal links need `swcd` (`web`).
- The Contacts, Photos, and Calendar pickers can act up without their categories.

`simslim profiles` lists every category, so you can keep a category with `--except` or individual daemons with `--keep`.

## Why

Testing is shifting. Once agents are writing apps, you want agents running them too, and the place an iOS app runs is a simulator. One agent, one simulator. So how much work you get through at once comes down to how many simulators a machine can hold, and stock simulators are heavy enough that a laptop fills up fast. Slimming them is the cheapest way to raise that ceiling: more simulators on the box means more agents working in parallel on it.
